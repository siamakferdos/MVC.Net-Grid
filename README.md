# MVC.Net-Grid
A custom grid for Asp.net MVC


Hi! This is a grid for Asp.Net MVC which can integrated with domain models. It's usage is simple and can be extend easily. Here's how to use this component


# Requirements

To use MVC-Grid, at first, it needs to add some dll to project including 

 1. Shoniz.Common.Core 
 2. Shoniz.Common.Web 
 3. Shoniz.Common.Web.MVC
 4. Newtonsoft.Json 
 5. System.Web.Razor
In addition, it needs to add a javaScript file to view page named  **MvcGrid.js**

Note: Shoniz.Common.Core and Shoniz.Common.Web  are separated project which I put their sources in this solution too.
